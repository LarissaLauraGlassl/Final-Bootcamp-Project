# How to choose a hotel?

## Motivation

In our digital world, it is common to read up online on a new product or service before buying it. One popular way to get information is by assessing previous customersâ€™ experiences. This project tries to generate insights on what to look for when inspecting hotel ratings and reviews.


## Data 

The research question has been addressed using real data from booking.com which is part of a larger dataset available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/jiashenliu/515k-hotel-reviews-data-in-europe). 


## Description

Focusing on six capital cities across Europe, about 75% of all reviewed hotels have an average score above 8 in 2016. With such little variation among hotel ratings, reviews and reviewer characteristics become even more important.

Overall, the analysis has provided strong evidence that the purpose of travelling is most important when selecting a hotel. It has been shown that people travelling for business and people travelling for leisure value different things and value same things differently. 

Only deviations from expectations seem to affect a reviewer's score, with negative deviations having a stronger impact on average. Business travellers tend to include positives more into evaluation whereas "vacationers" are found to only take "loved/lovely" things into account.

Based on these findings, a hotel recommender has been generated.


## Presentation
A Tableau presentation has been created to present the key findings of my analysis to my classmates (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/larissa2594/viz/Final_Project_16395903891110/Hotelreviews?publish=yes).
